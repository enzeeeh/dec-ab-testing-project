- **Statistical Test:** Mann-Whitney U (non-parametric, robust to outliers)
- **Effect Size:** r = 0.050 (small but consistent)

**Business Impact:**
- Near 3× increase in product additions from novelty section
- Higher revenue generation confirmed
- Both primary metrics significant after correction

**Recommendation:** **IMPLEMENT IMMEDIATELY**  
**Confidence Level:** ★★★★★ (Very High)  
**Expected ROI:** High - demonstrated across 16,000 sessions

---

#### 2. Menu Navigation Test ❌ **KEEP VARIANT A**

- **Statistical Test:** Two-Proportion Z-Test + Mann-Whitney U

**Business Impact:**
- Small but statistically significant improvement in one metric
- No impact on revenue or conversion
- Effect size is weak

**Recommendation:** **CONDUCT COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS**  
**Confidence Level:** ★★★☆☆ (Medium)  
**Consideration:** Balance 1.5% improvement against implementation/licensing costs

### ❌ No Action - Skip Implementation

#### 5. Reviews Test ❌ **NO EFFECT DETECTED**

**Feature:** No Featured vs Featured Reviews

**Results:**
- **Conversion Rate:** No difference (p = 0.7764)
- **Add-to-Cart Rate:** No difference (p = 0.2332)
- **Statistical Test:** Two-Proportion Z-Test
- **Sample Size:** 42,000 sessions (well-powered)

**Business Impact:**
- Zero measurable effect despite large sample
- Featured reviews provide no benefit
- Resources better allocated elsewhere

**Recommendation:** **DO NOT IMPLEMENT**  
**Confidence Level:** ★★★★☆ (High)  
**Resource Optimization:** Avoid wasting development effort

## Implementation Roadmap

### Immediate (Within 1 Month)

1. **Deploy Personalized Novelty Slider**
   - Expected Impact: +283% product additions from novelties
   - Technical Effort: Medium
   - Business Value: High

2. **Confirm Horizontal Menu Retention**
   - Action: Document decision not to implement dropdown
   - Expected Impact: Avoid -10% revenue loss

   - Calculate total cost of ownership (licensing, integration, maintenance)
   - Compare against 1.51% add-to-cart improvement
   - Make ROI-based decision

### Archived

5. **Featured Reviews**
   - No implementation planned

## Statistical Foundation

### Tests Applied

| Metric Type | Statistical Test | Tests Using This |
|-------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Binary (conversions, clicks) | Two-Proportion Z-Test | 10 metrics |
| Continuous (revenue, skewed) | Mann-Whitney U Test | 5 metrics |
| Continuous (3 variants) | Kruskal-Wallis H-Test | 5 metrics |
| Categorical | Chi-Square Test | 1 metric |

### Multiple Testing Correction

**Method:** Holm-Bonferroni  
**Purpose:** Control family-wise error rate when testing multiple metrics per experiment  
**Result:** 8 of 18 metrics remain significant after correction

### Effect Sizes Calculated

- **Relative Lift:** For binary metrics (e.g., +283%, -10.34%)
- **Cohen's d:** For normal continuous metrics
- **Rank-Biserial r:** For skewed continuous metrics (Mann-Whitney)
- **Cramér's V:** For categorical outcomes (Chi-Square)

## Data Quality Assurance

### Validation Results (All Tests Passed)

✅ **Sample Ratio Mismatch:** No allocation bias detected (p = 1.0 for all tests)  
✅ **Randomization Balance:** Excellent demographic balance (max SMD = 0.039)  
✅ **Temporal Stability:** Consistent allocation over time (max CV = 0.057)  
✅ **Data Integrity:** No critical missing data or corruption  
✅ **Sample Sizes:** Adequate for detecting 5% effects (except Test 1 at 6.8%)

### Minor Warnings (Non-Critical)

⚠️ **Duplicate Session IDs:** 50% of records (likely intentional data structure)  
⚠️ **Test 1 (Menu):** Slightly underpowered (6.8% MDE vs 5% target)  
⚠️ **Test 4 (Reviews):** 17.1% outliers detected (handled via robust methods)

**Assessment:** None of these warnings invalidate the analysis. Robust non-parametric methods used where appropriate.
